                    Macbeth is a tragedy by William Shakespeare about a brave Scottish general named <strong class="text-purple-400">Macbeth</strong> who encounters three witches on a battlefield. They prophesy that he will become king one day. Fueled by ambition and encouraged by his ruthless wife, <strong class="text-pink-400">Lady Macbeth</strong>, he murders <strong class="text-red-400">King Duncan</strong> to take the throne. However, this act sets off a chain of guilt and paranoia.

                <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    After becoming king, Macbeth grows increasingly fearful of losing his power, especially because the witches predicted that <strong class="text-blue-400">Banquo's</strong> descendants will inherit the throne. To prevent this, Macbeth arranges the murder of Banquo and his son <strong class="text-cyan-400">Fleance</strong>. Though Banquo is killed, Fleance escapes, leaving Macbeth haunted by guilt and the fear of losing control. This act further isolates Macbeth from those around him.

                    As Macbeth's tyranny grows, he becomes ruthless, ordering the slaughter of <strong class="text-orange-400">Macduff's</strong> family and trusting in the witches' ambiguous prophecies to protect him. Meanwhile, Macduff joins forces with <strong class="text-yellow-400">Malcolm</strong>, Duncan's son, to overthrow Macbeth. Lady Macbeth, unable to cope with the guilt of her actions, descends into madness and eventually dies.

                    In the final act, Malcolm leads an army to attack Macbeth's castle. The witches' prophecy comes true as the forest of <strong class="text-green-400">Birnam Wood</strong> appears to move toward Dunsinane, and Macduff kills Macbeth, revealing he was born by cesarean section—"not of woman born." Malcolm is crowned king, restoring order and justice to Scotland.
