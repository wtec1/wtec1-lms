            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">Story Overview</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-justify text-gray-700">
                <p>The Pearl is a powerful novella by John Steinbeck that explores themes of hope, greed, and the consequences of ambition. The story centers on Kino, a poor pearl diver, who discovers an enormous and perfect pearl, which he believes will bring his family a better future. The pearl itself becomes a symbol of both promise and danger throughout the narrative.</p>
                
                <p>At first, the pearl represents hope and opportunity. Kino dreams of using its wealth to provide education for his son Coyotito, improve their living conditions, and gain respect within the community. The pearl ignites a vision of escape from poverty and hardship, filling Kino and his family with excitement and optimism.</p>
                
                <p>However, as the story progresses, the pearl's symbolism shifts. It becomes a source of greed, envy, and conflict. The villagers, pearl buyers, and even strangers begin to covet the pearl, leading to deceit, betrayal, and violence. Kino's obsession with protecting and profiting from the pearl drives him to become increasingly suspicious and aggressive, changing his character.</p>
                
                <p>The pearl also represents the corrupting power of wealth. What initially seems like a blessing turns into a curse, bringing suffering instead of happiness. Kino's family faces attacks, and the tragedy of Coyotito's death is tied directly to the pearl's influence. Steinbeck uses the pearl to show how material desires can destroy what is truly valuable: family, peace, and integrity.</p>
                
                <p>In the end, Kino realizes that the pearl's promise was an illusion, and he throws it back into the sea, rejecting the greed and destruction it caused. This act symbolizes a return to natural balance and acceptance of life's realities. The Pearl ultimately warns against the dangers of ambition fueled by greed, reminding readers that true wealth lies beyond material possessions.</p>
